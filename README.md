## Conclusion and Recommendation
Based on the findings from this analysis, the following were recommended
1. Award returning customers with an incentive that targets TVs and PC in both Computech and MicroWorld to help increase sales of these items.
2. Seek customer feedback to improve sales across the stores further.
3. Top Managers should be given incentives eg cashback, vouchers, Value awards, etc for their effort and their methods should be studied across the teams in each store
4. The month of April is a peak month, so discount sales and other incentives should be encouraged to further increase the sales.
5. Factors like store location, quality of residents and quality of staff may need to be further investigated in MicroWorld to help enhance sales too.
